I’m a New Yorker with a love for pizza, museums, playlists, Manhattans, and Phil Collins. (Nobody’s perfect.)

For the past 15 years, I’ve worked as a designer making brands, books, interfaces, and illustrations. I now do client work through my design practice, frank.

My work has been recognized by the Art Directors Club, Print Magazine, and Commercial Arts, and select projects have been featured by The Atlantic, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, Time, Slate, Monocle, and adopted by The New Yorker. (It’s a long story.)

Back in 2015, I helped co-found Abstract, a software company focused on supporting a modern, collaborative, and open design process. I still serve as an advisor.

I believe in wide curiosity, “good trouble”, and ending up where you’re not supposed to be. Everyone is a fellow traveller.I’m a New Yorker with a love for pizza, museums, playlists, Manhattans, and Phil Collins. (Nobody’s perfect.)
